# Handoff Instructions: Conversation A v1

## Summary of Previous Conversation

- Explored the idea of a persistent, modular memory for AI-assisted project work, leveraging a GitHub repository for storage and continuity.
- Discussed core challenges: conversation continuity, cross-conversation indexing, extensibility, and behavioral guardrails.
- Proposed and refined a modular repo structure to support project growth, documentation, and feature development.
- Clarified workflow, folder structure, and the process for maintaining and evolving project knowledge.
- Addressed technical limitations regarding repository creation from different interfaces (web vs. mobile app).
- Confirmed use of EU date format (dd-mm-yyyy) for all metadata and logs.

## Key Decisions

- Repository name: `copilot-memory`
- Modular architecture with clear folder structure for conversations, indexes, modules, tasks, and instructions.
- Explicit support for project/conversation instructions, behavioral guardrails, and handoff/lessons-learned templates.
- All metadata and logs should use EU date format.
- Manual repository creation required due to current API limitations (especially in GitHub Android app).

## Lessons Learned

- Modular, extensible structure is key for growth and adaptability.
- Documenting instructions, guardrails, and decisions enables better continuity and handoffs.
- Technical environment (interface/platform) impacts what Copilot can automate directly.
