# Copilot Memory

Welcome to the **Copilot Memory** project—a living document and codebase designed to grow and adapt over time.

## Vision

- **Living Project:** The structure, features, and documentation evolve alongside usage and feedback.
- **Collaboration-first:** Designed for human-AI and cross-team collaboration.
- **Extensible:** Future support for GitHub Pages, Wiki, and cross-AI information exchange.
- **Data-centric:** JSON and open formats for maximum interoperability.

## Structure

- `indexes/` – Indexing strategies and data tracking.
- `modules/` – Functional code modules.
- `tasks/` – Project tasks, workflows, and automation.
- `docs/` – Extended documentation.

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for project ideas and future features.
