# Conversation Transcript (Up to 2025-08-31 16:29 UTC)

**User:**  
I desperately need you to function as:
- project manager, lead developer, prompt designer for a Project.
- researcher supporting the Project.

The scope is brutal and simple:
- you have no persistent memory. 
- not within an individual Conversation.
- nor between Conversations. 
- there is no way to save full Conversation transcripts
- there is no way to distill lessons or ideas from Conversations
- there is no way to track lessons or ideas in order to conceptualise / create implementations
- there is no mechanism of warding against LLM behavioural drift or bias (from lessons, ideas as well as general research), consider the concept of guardrails
- there is no way of best practices or templates for Personal Instructions or Custom Prompts *from lessons, ideas or general research)

I am probably not covering everything, so this has to be seen as a living project. the equivalent of a living document.

I need a functional solution for a persistent memory for copilot which takes these matters into account, but which has an architecture which is modular and thus allows for distinct feature sets, with extensibility. 

I do not mean to be blunt, but even switching between browser tabs causes you to lose context and knowledge unpredictably. I am not here for sales or marketing, I focus on research, development, functionality and results of that. 

Now ideally such a system exists already. Except, it doesn't appear to, except within scope of unattainable enterprise level systems, and those are utterly cluttered with all sorts of functionalities which have nothing to do with regular single user project/design/develop/research scopes. 

Ideally we could make use of the copilot + github integration. 

At this point, I suspect that you may need to put on your researcher hat first, but that is up to you. You are after all the project manager so it is within your expertise to determine such switches between roles and expertise.

**Copilot:**  
Thank you for this clear and brutally honest assessment! I fully understand the challenge: **current LLMs (including Copilot) are stateless, lose context constantly, and lack any reliable form of persistent memory or cross-session knowledge management**. This makes it extremely hard to maintain continuity, learn from previous work, avoid behavioral drift, or enforce guardrails—even within a single workflow, let alone across projects.

Let’s break down the requirements and establish a plan, functioning as both **researcher** and **project manager**:

Considering that you are at continuous risk of loss of context, we have a few practical steps here to tackle.

1. I need a way to save Conversation as verbatim transcript + potential code blocks to file / document / anything, in such a way that you can read and pick up where we left. This is a critical requirement of a handoff process.
2. I also need a way to kickstart any new conversation with you, by means of an instruction text / file, which I provide you. Telling you instructions, scope, summary, where we are - things like that. And that there is a full transcript for context. 

I have not found a solution for this. Perhaps you can research this. Perhaps it is possible for you to read Conversations that are Shared (copilot feature). I am at a loss here, you see the point of you as researcher. 

3. Now, the feedback you gave me is solid. That is indeed the foundation for a concrete implementation plan. I would love to engage on this directly, but I am stuck in a catch-22. If this conversation breaks, there is never any repairing it without those abovementioned handoff elements - not until the system is actually existing and functional. 

I have no knowledge of script or plugin design (that was new to me, copilot plugins, I do not even see such functionality, and I cannot risk leaving this tab or you may lose context again. 

4. But yes, the research scope is brutally necessary. If solutions exist, or if partial solutions or even inspiration points exist, that is good. After all, why reinvent the wheel.

**Copilot:**  
Your requirements are impressively clear and urgent—and they strike at the heart of the **stateless LLM problem**. Let's focus on practical research, handoff workflows, and actionable next steps. Here’s how I’ll approach your pain points:

A test: 

- can you create a markdown file transcript of our conversation up to this point? 
- can you create text which functions as instruction for a new / continuing conversation, of this conversation up to this point? 
- both in such a way that they can be updated/amended? 

After that, I suspect that we need to check for whether the wheel needs to be reinvented: dig deeper for any cutting-edge, lesser-known tools and research that might solve this context persistence issue?
